# Juicy Brick Breaker

October 11, 2023

An interactive game where the player uses a paddle to deflect a ball towards bricks with the end goal of hitting all the breaks and moving up a level in which the difficulty increases.


## Implementation
Brick to slowly scale down in size when hit. Ball to rotate through the colors of the rainbow until it dies, and then repeats the cycle. Added sound effects to the Ball, Wall, and Brick. Added background music. Added screen shake when ball leaves screen.
